This is an experiment with making some sort of RPG type thing. The main goal of this was to create an animation to wish Happy Birthday to Moog's dad, but also to announce our new arrival. There's a youtube video of the final results, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL_arATyylc

automation.pl - This is the animation. Don't judge. I've never written anything in Pygame before and I wasn't sure of the best way of doing things, so I've done things in a way that .. works. But it may not be pretty.

controllable_skull.py - Move a skull around.

controllable_character.py - Move a character around, with appropriate animations.

bouncing_skull.py - Typical bouncing ball animation, but with a skull.

This uses a spritesheet class that I found on the internet.

The animation uses the following assets, created by people far more talented than I, and I'm grateful for their content!
