I'm currently playing around with pygame.. here are my things.

I made a video to announce the arrival of my daughter - it's an RPG engine (sort of) written in Python with Pygame. The actual code for that lives here:

   - sword/automated.py

You view the final video here:

I'm also playing with the idea of creating an actual game with pygame - it's great.
